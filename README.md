This is a basic Calculator project and can evaluate binary maths expression with ```+, -, *, /``` operator. This project intends to present how best coding principles and design patterns can be applied in real-world projects for better scalability and readability. We have taken a very basic example of a calculator, to allow beginners to understand the beauty of clean coding and start apply best practices in their projects. The project is a very good example of how ```interfaces``` and ```factory pattern``` can be incorporated in even basic projects to avoid overuse of ```Switch-Case Statement``` and ```If-Else statement```.
